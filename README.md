## Environmental Data Analysis (Data 88 Spring 2022)

**Developer Team**: Aaron Moore, Caitlin Yee, Kinsey Long, Peter Flo Grinde-Hollevik, Hans Ocampo

Environmental Data Analysis, taught by [Dan Hammer](https://danham.me/r), will teach practical skills to address climate change and environmental conservation using data and building on what you've learned in DATA 8.

The `main` branch of this Github repository will reflect the most recent **Lecture notes**. _Note that the Datahub links will not be live until Wednesday at 10am PT, following the Tuesday lecture. In fact, all Lecture notes and topics are subject to change until the **day** of lecture._ Additional resources for the course can be found on [bcourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1513076). You will need to be enrolled in the class to see the additional resources, but the Lectures will remain public.

Please contact Head TA Peter F. Grinde-Hollevik with any questions.  He knows everything.
